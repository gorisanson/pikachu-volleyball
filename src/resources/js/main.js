/*
 * This is the main script which executes the game.
 *
 ********************************************************************************************************************
 * This web version of the Pikachu Volleyball is made by
 * reverse engineering the core part of the original Pikachu Volleyball game
 * which is developed by "1997 (C) SACHI SOFT / SAWAYAKAN Programmers" & "1997 (C) Satoshi Takenouchi".
 *
 * "physics.js", "cloud_and_wave.js", and some codes in "view.js" are the results of this reverse engineering.
 * Refer the comments in each file for the machine code addresses of the original functions.
 ********************************************************************************************************************
 *
 * This web version game is mainly composed of three parts which follows MVC pattern.
 *  1) "physics.js" (Model): The physics engine which takes charge of the dynamics of the ball and the players (Pikachus).
 *                           It is gained by reverse engineering the machine code of the original game.
 *  2) "view.js" (View): The rendering part of the game which depends on pixi.js (https://www.pixijs.com/, https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js) library.
 *                       Some codes in this part is gained by reverse engineering the original machine code.
 *  3) "pikavolley.js" (Controller): Make the game work by controlling the Model and the View according to the user input.
 *
 * And expainations for other source files are below.
 *  - "cloud_and_wave.js": This is also a Model part which takes charge of the clouds and wave motion in the game. Of course, it is also rendered by "view.js".
 *                         It is also gained by reverse engineering the original machine code.
 *  - "keyboard.js": Support the Controller("pikavolley.js") to get a user input via keyboard.
 *  - "audio.js": The game audio or sounds. It depends on pixi-sound (https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-sound) library.
 *  - "rand.js": For the random function used in the Models ("physics.js", "cloud_and_wave.js").
 *  - "assets_path.js": For the assets (image files, sound files) locations.
 *  - "ui.js": For the user interface (menu bar, buttons etc.) of the html page.
